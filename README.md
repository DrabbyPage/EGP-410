Building instructions are left up to the student. 

1. A link to your commit on GitHub 
     Editor's Commit link: https://github.com/DrabbyPage/EGP-410

2. How to compile/link your project 
     To compile the code, clone the repository. After cloning go into the GameAI folder. Inside
the folder is the component steering SDL folder. Lastly open the .sln file called steering.sln
I recommend running the program in Visual Studios 2017. Make sure that all libraries are running
your platform's proper SDK.

3. The keyboard inputs 
     - Left Mouse Click: moves the player to the point
     - Enter: Spawns a random unit
     - D: Deletes a random unit
     - Esc: Exits the program
